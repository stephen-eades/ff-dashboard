        <nb-card-body> Every ESPN fantasy league is assigned a league ID at creation. This site uses that ID
          to gather, analyze, and display your data so you can learn more about your league. View
          current standings, see stats from past seasons, or even track trades and league trends.
          <br>
          <br>
          When you visit espn.com and go to your league home page, you'll see the league ID in the URL.
          The data that you see populating this site is all retreived from your ESPN league, and we update the data
          everytime you visit this site.
          <br>
          <br>
          We made this site to help fantasy football players get deeper insight about their leagues.
